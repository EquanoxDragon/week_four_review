		<h2> Observations of how I'm learning this stuff </h2>
		<p> I feel as though I am slowly starting to understand this. I'm glad I'm starting to record what I'm actually putting in the comand lines/terminal so that I can actually get a good understanding of what I need to do. I now have a slightly better understanding of how to push and pull the saved branches to alter these files in a non destructive way. I must say when the prof actually slows down to explain what's going on it's a lot less scary. </p>
